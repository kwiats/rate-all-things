# RAT - voice messanger 

## Overview

RAT, short for "Rate All Things," initially began without a fully fleshed-out concept. However, it has since evolved into a more thoughtfully designed project. As development progresses, we aim to transform RAT into a robust voice messaging platform. This platform will incorporate various features including user authentication, real-time communication through websockets, and a middleware architecture to ensure scalability and security.
